MAP:
Map can be used when you want to create a new iterable object whose values are derived fromt he existing iterable object

var officers = [
  { id: 20, name: 'Captain Piett' },
  { id: 24, name: 'General Veers' },
  { id: 56, name: 'Admiral Ozzel' },
  { id: 88, name: 'Commander Jerjerrod' }
];

officers.map(officer=>officer.id )

Reduce:
Reduce can be used when you want to aggregate the derived results of each elements in iterable (array)

var pilots = [
  {
    id: 10,
    name: "Poe Dameron",
    years: 14,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Temmin 'Snap' Wexley",
    years: 30,
  },
  {
    id: 41,
    name: "Tallissan Lintra",
    years: 16,
  },
  {
    id: 99,
    name: "Ello Asty",
    years: 22,
  }
];


var TotalExperience=pilots.reduce((accumulator,piot)=> accumulator+piot.years,0)
