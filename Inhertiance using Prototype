PROTOTYPE CHAINING:

In Javascript functions (constructor as well as normal funcction) are object, they have properties and methods.

Let us talk about a custom constructor - Student
    function Student(id,dob){
      this.Id=id;
      this.Dob=dob;
      this.getExactAge= function(){  /*code to calcualte and retrun age*/}
    }

Now let us instantiate the Student Constructor
    std1= new Student(100,"13/09/1991");
    
    While instantiating student object , it is noted that all the properties (Id and Dob) and methods (getExactAge) of the custom constructor Student will also be added part of the 
    instantiated object std1. And for each object created out of Student constructor have these properties and methods, however each have a different copies with different values.
    
      std1.Id // prints 100
      std1.Dob //prints 13/09/1991
      std1.getExactAge() //executtes getExactAge.
     
     let us instantiate the second object
    std2=  new Student(101,"10/09/1993")
    
      std1.Id // prints 101
      std1.Dob //prints 10/09/1993
      std1.getExactAge() //executtes getExactAge.
      std1.getExactAge==std2.getExactAge //return false as both the object have a different copiies of the function.
      
   Every functions(Normal function,custom constructor and Inbuilt constructor(Function)) in javascirpt  will have a property called Prototype which points to an object. And while instantiating the 
   constructor, all the properties and methods of the ProtoType Object will become the properties and methods of the instantiated object. However each instantiated object shares same 
   copies of those properties and methods. When one those properties or methods are modified in one of the object , the changes will get reflected on all the other instanticated object.
   
   Which Object does the prototype points to ? It points to an Javascript "Object". I can also point to any object, even the one which you have created/instantiated when you implement inhertiance.
   
   What are the attributes of prototype object?  It has a method and properties which any javscript object has. Here are some of the attributes which comes by default on any Object.
   
                            Properties: 
                             1. __proto__
                            Methods: 
                             1. constructor
                             2. hasOwnProperty
                             3. isPrototypeOf
                             4. propertyIsEnumerable
                             5. toLocaleString
                             6. toString
                             7. valueOf
                             8. __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__
                             9.__lookupGetter__ and __lookupSetter__
    
    

            1. All the properties and methods of the Student Constructor  
                  AND
            2. All the properties and methods of the ProtoType Object
            
            Each instatiated object contains its own copy of properties and methods which  are applied from the custom constructor. However all the instatiated object will share the 
            same copy of properties and methods which are applied from Prototype Object.
