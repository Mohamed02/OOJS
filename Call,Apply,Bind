BIND:
Bind is used to create a copy of a function, whose context (this) is tied to an object passed along with the bind function

function printname(){
console.log("Name is "+this.name)
}
obj1={name:"Ismail"}
user1= printname.bind(obj1);
user1();


When the above function is writtern as arrow function bind wont work because , arrow funciton doesnt have a context(this) associated with it. when we refere this 
inside an arrow function , it will refer to the parent context.

CALL and APPLY:

Call is used to invoke a function by passing a context to it.

function printname(a,b){
console.log("Name is "+this.name+"a :"+a+" b: "+b)
}
printname.call({name:"Ismail"},"HI","Hellow");
printname.apply({name:"Ismail"},["HI","Hellow"]);
