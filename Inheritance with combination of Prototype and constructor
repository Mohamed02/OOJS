Drawback of Inhertiance using constructor stealing.

    Execute the code in teh file Inheritance usign constructor and then execute followng scripts

        
          henObj2=new Hen();
        henObj1.move== henObj2.move . //retruns false

  Issue: Each instance carries new copy of properties and methods , there is not way to share properties or methods among instances


Drawback of Inhertiance using prototype.

    Execute the code in teh file Inheritance usign constructor and then execute followng scripts

        TigerA= new Tiger();
        GoatB= new Goat();
             
        TigerA.migration // the returns an array of one element 'walk'.
        TigerA.migraiton.push('run');  //now let us push value in the migration array
        
        GoatB.migration // this returns of array of two element - walk and run.

  Issue: Since all the instances share the same copy of instances properties( applicable only for arrays and Objects which are passed by reference ). 
  When a property is modifed by one instance, it would affect all other instance. this issue is not appliable when we modify primitive values such as string on 
  integer
        TigerA.noOfEyes  // returns 2
        
        TigerA.noOfEyes=4
        
        GoatB.noOfEyes //returns 2 and it is remains un affected by change in TigerA.
  
  
  Solution to the above problem: Go for combination of Costructor stealing and Prototype:
  
  for properties or methods you dont want to share it across instances , put it in constructor, the properties you want to be accessed across all the instances 
  put in proto type
  
  
  
          function SuperType(name){
              this.name = name;
              this.colors = [“red”, “blue”, “green”];
              }
              SuperType.prototype.sayName = function(){
              alert(this.name);
        };
        function SubType(name, age){
        //inherit properties
        SuperType.call(this, name);
        this.age = age;
        }  

          SubType.prototype = new SuperType();
        SubType.prototype.sayAge = function(){
        alert(this.age);
        };
        var instance1 = new SubType(“Nicholas”, 29);
        instance1.colors.push(“black”);
        alert(instance1.colors); //”red,blue,green,black”
        instance1.sayName(); //”Nicholas”;
        instance1.sayAge(); //29
        var instance2 = new SubType(“Greg”, 27);
        alert(instance2.colors); //”red,blue,green”
        instance2.sayName(); //”Greg”;
        instance2.sayAge(); //27
