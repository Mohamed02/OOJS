Hoisting in JS


  1. Execut the below code in browser console
  
  console.log("the value of a is "+a);   //thrws the Reference error which indicates teh a is neither declared nor defined
  
  2. Execute the below code
  
  console.log("the value of a is "+a);    //the value is of a is undefined
  var a;
  
  /* here though a is declared after console statment, variable declaration of a is hoisted to top the scope
  
  
  Issues due to hoisting
 
          / Initialize x in the global scope
        var x = 100

        function hoist() {
          
              console.log(x)
             var x = 200;
          }

        hoist()
        
        
   /// we expect the above function to return 100. But it return undefined. Thats becoz withing the function hoist(), the variable x declaration will get hoisted 
   to top of scope . but as it value is not initialized it will return undefined error.
   
   
   to avoid this it is recommended to use the let keyword constant, whose declaration will not get hoisted, as those declartion is confied within the block scope
   
   
   
          / Initialize x in the global scope
        var x = 100

        function hoist() {
          
          console.log(x)
          if(3==4){
            let x = 200
            }
          
        }

        hoist()
