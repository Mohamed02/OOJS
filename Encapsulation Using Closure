CLOSURE:
 
 It is the capablity of Javascript which facilitates , accessing a variable within a scope(inner scope) from outer scope.
 
 Closure can be used to implement 
    -> Encapsulation
    -> Callback function
    
 Callback Function:
        In the below function , when the settimeout is executed, the anonymous callback function within settimeout will get executed after 1000ms , When the anonymous call back function 
        is executed it will be executed in the global scope and not inside the function scope of student. However the anonymous function can access teh variable name.
function student(){ 
            var name="Ismail"; 
            setTimeout(function(){ console.log(name);},1000);
            }
