CLOSURE:
 
 It is the capablity of Javascript which facilitates , accessing a variable within a scope(inner scope) from outer scope.
 
 Closure can be used to implement 
    -> Encapsulation
    -> Callback function
    
 Callback Function:
        In the below function , when the settimeout is executed, the anonymous callback function within settimeout will get executed after 1000ms , When the anonymous call back function 
        is executed it will be executed in the global scope and not inside the function scope of student. However the anonymous function can access teh variable name.
function student(){ 
            var name="Ismail"; 
            setTimeout(function(){ console.log(name);},1000);
            }


SIDE EFFECTS and PURE FUNCTION:

While we invoke the funciton , it will do some execution and return some values. In case if the function modifies the value of variable outside its scope, then it is called as side effect.

A function is called PURE function when there is zero side effect or if it doenst modify anything outside its scope.



Higher Order Funciton:

Higher order functions are functions which takes another functions as input parameter and executes that . Thus the Higher order funcitons remains generic as much as possible.

Array.Map is one such higher order function which will get transform the input array values into a new array values whose output is determined by execution of function which is 
given as input parameter.
